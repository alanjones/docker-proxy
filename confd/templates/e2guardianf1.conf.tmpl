# 50 is for young children,  100 for old children,  160 for young adults.

# Search term blocking
# Search terms can be extracted from search URLs and filtered using one or 
# both of two different methods.

# Method 1 is that developed by Protex where specific 
# search terms are contained in a bannedsearchlist.  
# (localbannedsearchlist and bannedsearchoveridelist can be used to suppliment 
# and overide this list as required.)  
# These lists contain banned search words combinations on each line.  
# Words are separated by '+' and must be in sorted order within a line.
#    so to block 'sexy girl' then the list must contain the line
#    	girl+sexy
#    and this will block both 'sexy girl' and 'girl sexy'
# To use this method, the searchregexplist must be enabled and the bannedsearchlist(s) defined

# Method 2 is uses the 
# bannedphraselist, weightedphraselist and exceptionphraselist, with a separate
# threshold for blocking than that used for normal page content.
# To do this, the searchregexplist must be enabled and searchtermlimit 
# must be greater than 0.
 
#
# Search engine regular expression list (need for both options)
# List of regular expressions for matching search engine URLs.  It is assumed
# that the search terms themselves will be contained in the 
# of output of each expression.

# Search term limit (for Option 2)
# The limit over which requests will be blocked for containing search terms
# which match the weightedphraselist.  This should usually be lower than the
# 'naughtynesslimit' value above, because the amount of text being filtered
# is only a few words, rather than a whole page.

#
# Search term phrase lists (for Option 2) 
# If the three lines below are uncommented, search term blocking will use
# the banned, weighted & exception phrases from these lists, instead of using
# the same phrase lists as for page content.  This is optional but recommended,
# as weights for individual phrases in the "normal" lists may not be
# appropriate for blocking when those phrases appear in a much smaller block
# of text.
# Please note that all or none of the below should be uncommented, not a
# mixture.

# This option only applies to pages blocked by weighted phrase filtering.
# Defines the minimum score that must be accumulated within a particular
# category in order for it to show up on the block pages' category list.
# All categories under which the page scores positively will be logged; those
# that were not displayed to the user appear in brackets.
#
# -1 = display only the highest scoring category
# 0 = display all categories (default)
# > 0 = minimum score for a category to be displayed
categorydisplaythreshold = 0

# Embedded URL weighting
# When set to something greater than zero, this option causes URLs embedded within a
# page's HTML (from links, image tags, etc.) to be extracted and checked against the
# bannedsitelist and bannedurllist. Each link to a banned page causes the amount set
# here to be added to the page's weighting.
# The behaviour of this option with regards to multiple occurrences of a site/URL is
# affected by the weightedphrasemode setting.
